description: The mnemonic functions of hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) have
  been studied extensively. Because hippocampal outputs affect not only cortical but
  also subcortical targets, we examined the impact of SPW-Rs on the firing patterns
  of lateral septal (LS) neurons in behaving rats. A large fraction of SPW-Rs were
  temporally locked to high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (120–180 Hz) in LS, with
  strongest coupling during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, followed by waking
  immobility. However, coherence and spike-local field potential (LFP) coupling between
  the two structures were low, suggesting that HFOs are generated locally within the
  LS GABAergic population. This hypothesis was supported by optogenetic induction
  of HFOs in LS. Spiking of LS neurons was largely independent of the sequential order
  of spiking in SPW-Rs but instead correlated with the magnitude of excitatory synchrony
  of the hippocampal output. Thus, LS is strongly activated by SPW-Rs and may convey
  hippocampal population events to its hypothalamic and brainstem targets.
